        <h2 class="title">Melaka River Cruise</h2>
        <h3 class="caption">"The River That Flowed Through Time"</h3>
        <p>
            Take a cruise through time in Malaysia’s most historic city, Melaka.
            Even before the beginning of the Melaka Sultanate in the 15th century,
            and through the years of foreign rule that occurred centuries after, the Melaka River flowed.
            It was there when the Portuguese built the A’ Famosa fort in 1511, when the Dutch erected the Stadthuys in
            1888,
            and when the Japanese invaded Malaya in the Second World War.
        </p>
        <p> The Melaka River was there to witness Independence from the British.</p>

        <p>Its legacy still continues to flow till this day, in a period than the previous centuries. Contrary from what
            it was before as a vital trade route or a front to fend off invaders,
            the Melaka River is now home to the Melaka River Cruise.</p>

        <p>This 45-minute boat ride cruising along the vintage Melaka River moves at a peaceful pace, allowing one to
            admire the breathtaking view of Melaka. It’s just one of things that travellers should not miss when
            visiting the state.
            From the modern local icons to rustic colonial landmarks, here are some of the things you’ll see on the
            Melaka River Cruise.</p>

        <div id="box1">
            <b>Historical Landmarks of Different Eras</b>
            <p>Till today, infrastructure from Melaka’s colonial past still remains standing. As arguably Malaysia’s
                most historic state, the preservation of such buildings is important in ensuring that history is
                protected and serves as an acknowledgement of Malaysia’s significant past</p>
            <p>Today, many tourists who flock to Melaka make it a point to visit these historical landmarks. It’s no
                surprise, as Melaka City has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2008.</p>
            <p>Some notable landmarks which you’ll be cruising by are the Stadthuys and Red Building established by the
                Dutch in 1888, the Church of St. Francis Xavier completed in 1856, and the Bastion Middleburg erected in
                1660 to defend oncoming aggressors.</p>

        <div id="box2">
            <b>A Different Perspective</b>
            <p>It’s a different experience being in the crowd, and observing the crowd. Take the Melaka River cruise and
                see things from a different perspective. It is much less exhausting and it’ll allow you to serenely take
                in the sights and sounds as you cruise by. Idle away and gaze at the moving trishaws, the tourist
                crossing over bridges, and the picturesque shophouses as you spectate from a distance.</p>
            <p><b>Iconic Bridges</b></p>
            <p>Perhaps not known to many, Melaka has some of the most historic bridges in Malaysia. While they are not
                as grand or as large as the Golden Gate Bridge or the Brooklyn Bridge, they have very interesting
                stories behind them. There are a number of bridges along Melaka River, but some of which you should take
                note of is the:</p>
            <p><b><i>Tan Kim Seng Bridge</i></b> : This is the bridge that connects the Melaka Clock Tower area to
                Jonker Street. The bridge is named after a wealthy Peranakan businessman that contributed greatly to the
                community. The bridge was built in 1862, but was destroyed 80 years later in 1942 by the British. It was
                rebuilt and restored later on after World War 2 ended.</p>
            <p><b><i>Pasar Bridge</i></b> : This bridge was built during the Portuguese rule around the 1500’s, and it
                links Kampung Hulu to the Old Central Market. </p>
            <p><b><i>Chan Boon Cheng Bridge</i></b> : This bridge links the west and east side of the Melaka river bank,
                but it isn’t best known for that. Instead, it’s known for its gruesome past. During the Japanese
                Occupation, Japanese soldiers used to place the heads of executed victims at the foot of the bridge to
                instil fear into the locals. So, watch your head.</p>

            <b>Conclusion</b>

                is a river that is embedded in history and made this city a success in the first place. Popular with
