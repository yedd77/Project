        The Maritime Museum or the Flora de Lamar is a replica of the Portuguese ship which sank in the coast of Malacca while on its way to Portugal. The replica is a staggering 34 meters 
        in height and 8 meters in width. The main focus of the museum is the maritime history of Malacca and the golden ages of Malaccaâ€™s Sultanate as the Emporium of the East. There are 
        also paintings which displays how the Straits of Malacca was a strategic location for traders from both the east and the west stop by at Malacca/Melaka and conduct their 
        businesses while waiting for the monsoon winds to change direction. The museum has myriads of exhibits of articles such as porcelain, silk, textile and spices used by the seamen 
        of the yesteryears and even come sunken treasures hauled from Diana, another shipwreck. Other than exhibits on the history of the Malaccan Maritime, the museum also showcases 
        the different eras that Malacca has gone through starting from the Malacca Sultanate era to the Portuguese era, Dutch era and ending with the British era.<br><br>

        For ship fanatics, there are also a collection of different ship models that are on display at the museum. You will be able to learn more about the types of ships and their 
        functions from the collection. You can also climb up to the upper deck of the ship to view the diorama of the captain cabin. Admission into the museum is RM3 per adult 
        and RM1 per child. It is open daily from 9am to 5.30pm. While you are here, do not waste the opportunity to visit the other museums in the area. If you go up the St Paul's Hill 
        to get to the St Paul's Church, will you pass by two museums along the way. They are the Architecture Museum and the Stamp Museum. There is also the Islamic Museum of Malacca
         which is a tad further away from the Maritime Museum. If you are done with absorbing all the history of Malacca and the delicious food at Jonker Street, you can head over to 
         Dataran Pahlawan for some shopping. There are many shops in it and also some restaurants which serve good food.<br><br>
        
        On the top floor of Dataran Pahlawan is a cafe named Nadeje which sells the best layered cake in Malacca. The cakes come in various flavors and are about RM8.50 per piece. 
        If there isn't enough room to fit all the delicious food in your stomach, why not extend your stay? You can stay at any of the hotels in Malacca. There is no need to worry 
        about accommodation as there are plenty around.<br><br>

        <h3>Location</h3>
        <p>The Maritime Museum of Malacca is located just ahead of the Stadthuys. It is exactly opposite of the <b>Medan Samudera</b> which is a handicraft and local produce building. 
        The best way to get to the Maritime Museum from the Stadthuys is by walking as you can appreciate better the museums, galleries, mosques, churches and other historical 
        fort around Banda Hilir.

 <p>Although the Bandar Hilir area is not very big, but if you walk to visit all the interesting places here, you can definitely break your leg as well. If you are in an area like 
    the Ocean Museum or Studthuys Square want to have mixed rice lunch, one of the closest places you can stop is at <b>Medan Samudera</b></p> <br>

 <p>This destination may not be as popular as other interesting eateries or shopping places in Melaka , but it still has a function for tourists if the beams are already close to it 
    and you may also be in a situation where you do not want to walk further to other places because you are lazy or tired. The short story is ideal to be used as an R&R stop after a 
    tiring day visiting the museum on foot.</p><br>

            <i>The operating hours in Medan Samudera depend a lot on the respective traders. Some open early, some close early & 
            generally this destination is more lively when many tourists visit interesting places around Bandar Hilir Melaka:</i>
